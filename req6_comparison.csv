Item,Req6-1 (query_down structural),Req6-2 (query_up_paths),Req6-3 (query_down expanded),Req6-4 (proposal)
Primary use,"From a root cell, list instance records by depth (arrays not expanded)","From TOP, list paths to a target cell (segments)","From a root cell, list instance records by depth (arrays expanded)","Debug/analysis: detailed paths + direct parent/child queries"
Direction,Down,"Up (from TOP)",Down,"Up + local (parents/children)"
Array handling,"1 record per array instance","Traversal sees instance edges; does not expose per-array element","Expands regular arrays to per-element records with expanded_index","Includes detailed edges and (optionally) expanded variants"
Output core,instances[] records,paths[] (segments),instances[] records (expanded),paths[] with edge details + parents[]/children[] endpoints
Path context,"Each record has path segments from query root to parent cell containing the instance","Each path is segments=[gds, TOP, ..., target]","Each record has path segments from query root to parent cell containing the instance","Adds edge list per path; each edge carries instance metadata"
BBox,"Deep bbox (all layers) per instance record",Not included,"Deep bbox (all layers) per expanded element record","Required; useful on per-edge records and parent/child queries"
TooManyResults guardrail,"limit (default 10k) -> error TooManyResults","max_paths (default 10k) -> error TooManyResults","limit (default 10k) -> error TooManyResults","Applies to max_paths/limit similarly; clear message/comment required"
Multi top cell,Not required (root explicit cell),Error if multiple/no top cell,Not required (root explicit cell),TOP-based queries still error; local queries can be independent (needs decision)
Typical questions answered,"From this cell, what do I instantiate within N levels?","Where is this cell used (as a path from TOP)?","How many physical instance elements exist under this root (bounded by limit)?","Show chain and transforms/bboxes along each path; Who are my direct parents/children?"
